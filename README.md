# ircbot
It's a bot, for IRC.

For a list of parameters, run **./ircbot.py --help**  
(Will be replaced by a config file at some point)

Pretty much all of the functionality and commands are implemented as plugins, so just have a poke around the **plugins/**

# Christoph-Disclaimer
The bot is currently in an unfinished state and may contain approx. 291 security holes and bugs. **Do not** run this in any circumstances, that make your livelihood dependent on the stability and security of your IRC bot.
