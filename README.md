# Yui
A bot, for IRC.

Loads **config.json** by default, but you can also specify a different one as the first parameter on the commandline.

Pretty much all of the functionality and commands are implemented as plugins, so just have a poke around the **plugins/**

# Christoph-Disclaimer
The bot is currently in an unfinished state and may contain approx. 291 security holes and bugs. **Do not** run this in any circumstances, that make your livelihood dependent on the stability and security of your IRC bot.
