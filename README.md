# Yui
A bot, for IRC.

Pretty much all of the functionality and commands are implemented as plugins, so just have a poke around the **plugins/** dir.
For some basic config options, take a look at **config.json.example**.

# Expect Breakage
Esp. database schemata, but also other things, *will* be changed without warning, making your old db/config suddenly not work anymore. **git pull** at your own risk.
